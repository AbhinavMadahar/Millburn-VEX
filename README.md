Yes, there are a lot of people, which is why anyone can leave if they want to, and you can be kicked off if you repeatedly don't show up. That means you should show up and do something. If you can be replaced by a house plant, then there's something wrong. Unless that house plant is a cactus. They're unbeatable.

We plan on having meetings at least twice a week, although during some months (like September) we will have to go every weekday and Saturday because that's when the busy times are. The times are going to be from 3:30ish to 5:30ish, but athletes have to come from 5:30ish to 7:30ish. That means that you do not have an excuse. If you are sick or something, then stay updated. Software developers on the team can just read the git log to stay up-to-date, but you really should also make sure that you know the ideas we are making. As for hardware developers, you will just have to stay in contact somehow.

> The VEX team may seem like a B team, playing second-fiddle to the FIRST Robotics Team. That's because it is. However, it doesn't have to be- you all can make an amazing robot if you work together and try. Also, don't play the fiddle. It's not the 1600s.

That said, you're all probably programmers if you're reading this. Thusly, you need to know a few things, such as not using `Thusly` in actual speech. You may be 16 but it's not 1916. Look in the [wiki](https://github.com/AbhinavMadahar/Millburn-VEX/wiki) for them.
