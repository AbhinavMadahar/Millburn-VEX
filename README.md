Millburn High School VEX Team
=============================
This is the repository for the 2015 to 2016 team, which is taking part in the **Nothing but Net** challenge.

If you are not on the team, feel free to browse around. It's open source for a reason.

If you _are_ on the team, please make sure to join the Facebook group and keep updated on it.
Also, I personally recommend that you [unwatch](https://help.github.com/articles/unwatching-repositories/) the repository to avoid getting too many emails.

# Style Guide
I made this repository from blood and tears. Every single character was examined and thought-out. This is as close to perfection as I can get without having the RobotC compiler to check for me.

To maintain the quality of the repository, please follow the stylistic choices I have already chosen in the repository.

As a special note: use tabs for indentation, not spaces. This is so that we can easily change the indentation level based on our personal preference. I prefer 4 spaces but sometimes I like 8, and using tabs makes changing simple. Also, do not use tabs for alignment, use spaces. Remember to avoid alignment as well
