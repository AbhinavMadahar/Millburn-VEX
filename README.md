Millburn High School VEX Team
=============================
This is the repository for the 2015 to 2016 team, which is taking part in the **Nothing but Net** challenge.

If you are not on the team, feel free to browse around. It's open source for a reason.

If you _are_ on the team, please make sure to join the Facebook group and keep updated on it.
Also, I personally recommend that you [unwatch](https://help.github.com/articles/unwatching-repositories/) the repository to avoid getting too many emails.

# Style Guide
I made this repository from blood and tears. Every single character was examined and thought-out. This is as close to perfection as I can get without having the RobotC compiler to check for me.

To maintain the quality of the repository, please follow the stylistic choices I have already chosen in the repository.

As a special note: use tabs for indentation, not spaces. This is so that we can easily change the indentation level based on our personal preference. I prefer 4 spaces but sometimes I like 8, and using tabs makes changing simple. Also, do not use tabs for alignment, use spaces. Remember to avoid alignment as well

# RobotC
[API](http://help.robotc.net/WebHelpVEX/index.htm#Resources/topics/Welcome.htm%3FTocPath%3D_____1)

Creating a new Robotics File:

1. File > New > Competition Template

2. That should get you set up with the basic functions

3. Your "Text Functions" should match the ones shown in the API
